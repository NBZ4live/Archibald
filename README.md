## Configure Integrations

### Slash Command

Add a new **Slash Command** integration for your team.

For the Integration Settings, use the following values:

| Setting                   | Value                                         |
|---                        |---                                            |
| Command                   | /archie                                       |
| URL                       | http://yourOwnDomain.com/archibald/api.php    | 
| Method                    |  POST                                         |
| Autocomplete help text    | ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2084481/5191903/bdee426e-74f2-11e4-8bcb-61a547cc8fdd.png)            |
| Descriptive Label         | Archibald                                     |

Now copy the Token and paste it as a value for **SLASHCOMMAND_TOKEN** into `config.php`.

```php
    define('SLASHCOMMAND_TOKEN', 'Your copied Token here');
```

### Incoming Webhook

Now add a new **Incoming Webhook** integration for your team.

All you need to do in the settings for the **Incoming Webhook** integration is to copy the **Webhook URL** and paste it as a value for **WEBHOOK_URL** into `config.php`. All other values are overwritten by Archibald.

```php
    define('WEBHOOK_URL', 'The copied URL here');
```

## Config

In `config.php` you need to set the **Token** for the **Slash Command Integration** as well as the **Webhook URL** from the **Incoming Webhook Integration**.

## Upload files to Webserver

You need to upload all files to a webserver running PHP version 5.3.x or higher.

Before you upload the files, be sure to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to also include all vendor files.

```sh
composer install
```
